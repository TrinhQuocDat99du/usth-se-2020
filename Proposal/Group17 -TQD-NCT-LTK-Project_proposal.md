1. Background

Now today's education, there are many teachers who cannot apply technology to teaching, lack technology to support them to teach students or transfer knowledge quickly and conveniently. 
It's a setback of society, era 4.0 is the era of technology. So we have to create tools to support teachers and students
2. Proposal
2.1 Vision and Goals

We want to create a software to help manage students and give class information and grades to parents automatically, and a way to communicate and teach students online. This is also a place to provide teachers with student information, computers will analyze the effectiveness of the program and offer appropriate exercises for students. Then, our goals for making this app is
1.	Create connections with teachers and students
2.	Provide appropriate, homework materials for students
3.	Analyze students' intellectual ability and analyze information
4.	Send information to parents about student status
5.	Support users with useful information
2.2 Risks & Issues
| Project Risks |
1   Technology adoption
Parents and schools should be careful about using and instructing teachers to use technology commonly
2 The algorithms for analyzing student information need to be constantly checked, making it easy to make mistakes with extremely large data
| Project Issues |
1.	Large projects need coordinating parties and need student information provided by the school
2.	We do not have a big enough data base to learn from and build the software.
2.3 Implications
The development of the generation now needs the attention of technology and education. That combination allows us to have a good future, ensuring that the students are far ahead of their minds and the freedom to develop their talents. natural
In order to achieve that, we need the preparation of society and the school. Behavior analysis, knowledge, intelligence is not confinement but it is the key to discovering each student's ability. Helping parents understand their talents and support their talents.
The program does not just stop there but wants to build and develop to apply to our society. Understanding people to develop future social models.
